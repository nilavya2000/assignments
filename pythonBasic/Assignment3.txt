1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs? 

-> Functions helpes to reduce the duplicate code, makes program shorter easier to access. 

2. When does the code in a function run: when it's specified or when it's called? 

-> The function runs when it is called. 

3. What statement creates a function? 

-> def function_name()

-> Only one global scope is there and a local scope is created when a function is called. 

6. What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns? 

-> When a function is called local scope is destroyed and all the variables in it are forgotten. 

7. What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a return value in an expression? 

-> Return value is a value that is returns after the program execution. Yes we can return any value using a return statement. 

8. If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function? 

-> It will return None.  

9. How do you make a function variable refer to the global variable? 

-> We can use global keyword to make a variable global. 

10. What is the data type of None?

12. If you had a bacon() feature in a spam module, what would you call it after importing spam?

-> spam.bacon() 

13. What can you do to save a programme from crashing if it encounters an error? 

-> We can use try clause to prevent crashing.

14. What is the purpose of the try clause? What is the purpose of the except clause? 

-> In try clause we keep the code that may cause an error. and if an error occured what code should it execute we keep that in except clause.
